Server:
The server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure.
It is responsible for receiving and processing requests from users, serving web pages,
and handling database communication. In this scenario, we have one server serving all the required components.

Domain Name (www.foobar.com):
A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites on the internet.
In this case, "www.foobar.com" is the domain name.
It serves as a user-friendly alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
When a user types "www.foobar.com" in their browser, the DNS (Domain Name System) is used to resolve this domain name to the server's IP address, allowing users to reach the website.


DNS Record for www (www.foobar.com):
The DNS record "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a type of DNS record called a CNAME (Canonical Name) record.
It points the "www" subdomain to the root domain, which is "foobar.com" in this case.
This setup ensures that both "www.foobar.com" and "foobar.com" point to the same server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

Application Server:
The application server hosts the application code base. It is responsible for processing dynamic requests,
generating content based on user input or other data sources, and returning the result
to the web server. In this case, the application server is responsible for
handling the logic and generating web pages using the code base.

Database (MySQL):
The database stores and manages the website's data, such as user information, content, configurations, etc.
In this infrastructure, MySQL is used as the database system to handle data storage and retrieval.

Communication with the User's Computer:
When a user requests the website by typing "www.foobar.com" in their browser, the following steps occur:
1. The user's computer sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver to resolve "www.foobar.com" to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
2. The DNS resolver returns the server's IP address (8.8.8.8) to the user's computer.
3.The user's computer sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8) using port 80 (the default HTTP port).
4. he server (Nginx) receives the request and forwards it to the appropriate application server to process the request.
5. The application server processes the request, interacts with the database if needed, generates a dynamic response, and returns it to Nginx6. Nginx then sends the response back to the user's computer, which displays the website content in their browser.



Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
The infrastructure has a single server, making it vulnerable to a single point of failure.
If the server goes down for any reason, the entire website becomes inaccessible. To mitigate this,
 a load balancer and multiple servers can be introduced to distribute traffic and create redundancy.

2. Downtime during Maintenance:
During maintenance, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server (Nginx),
the website may experience downtime or temporary unavailability.
To minimize this, a strategy like rolling deployments can be used to update the web
 server or application server without causing a complete downtime.

3. Limited Scalability:
With only one server handling all the incoming traffic, the infrastructure may struggle to handle a high volume of users or traffic. Scaling options like adding more servers, implementing load balancing, or using a cloud-based infrastructure can help address this limitation and handle increased traffic efficiently.

To address these issues, it's essential to consider using a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic among multiple servers, employing redundant servers for high availability, and exploring cloud-based solutions to scale resources dynamically based on traffic demands. Additionally, using containerization or serverless architectures can offer more flexibility and scalability.
