Server: 
We have a single server in this setup that hosts the load balancer, web server,
 application server, and database. However, for high availability and redundancy,
 we will configure two HAproxy load balancers as a cluster to distribute incoming traffic.

Load Balancer (HAproxy) Cluster: 
We use two HAproxy load balancers in a cluster configuration. This ensures that if one load balancer fails,
the other can continue to distribute the incoming traffic,
providing fault tolerance and high availability.

Split Components on Separate Servers:
We have split the components (web server, application server, and database) onto separate
servers to optimize resource usage and improve performance. This separation also allows us
to scale each component independently if needed.

Web Server (Nginx, Your Code Base):
Nginx serves as the web server and hosts your code base, which includes the website's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static files.

Application Server: 
The application server is responsible for executing your web application's logic and processing dynamic requests.

Database Server: 
The database server stores and manages the website's data, handling read and write operations.

By splitting the components onto separate servers and using a load balancer cluster, we ensure better performance,
high availability, and the ability to scale each component independently based on the website's traffic
and resource requirements. This design promotes a robust and reliable web infrastructure.
