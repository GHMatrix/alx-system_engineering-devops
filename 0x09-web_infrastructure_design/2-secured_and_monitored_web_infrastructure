Three-Server Web Infrastructure:
We will have three servers to distribute the workload, provide redundancy, and improve fault tolerance.


Firewalls:
Firewalls are added to enhance security by controlling the incoming and outgoing network traffic.
They act as a barrier between the internet and the servers, allowing only authorized traffic and blocking potential threats.


SSL Certificate:
An SSL certificate is used to enable HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for the website. It encrypts the communication
 between the user's web browser and the server, ensuring that sensitive data,
 such as login credentials, remains secure during transmission.

Monitoring Clients:
Monitoring clients (data collectors) will be deployed on each server to collect performance metrics,
server health, and other important data. They will send this data to a monitoring service
 (e.g., Sumo Logic or other monitoring tools).

Why Firewalls:
Firewalls are essential for securing the infrastructure from unauthorized access, preventing
 malicious attacks, and controlling network traffic.

Why HTTPS:
HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between the user's browser and the server is
 encrypted, protecting sensitive information and maintaining user privacy.

Why Monitoring:
Monitoring is used to track the health and performance of the infrastructure, identify potential issues,
and enable proactive troubleshooting and maintenance.


How Monitoring Tool Collects Data:
Monitoring clients (data collectors) on each server will continuously gather
 data about server metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.), web server logs, application
 performance, and network statistics. This data will be sent to the monitoring
 service for analysis and visualization.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:
To monitor the web server's QPS (Queries Per Second), the monitoring tool will track the number
 of incoming requests per second to the server.
 This data will help identify peak traffic periods and potential performance bottlenecks.


Issues with this Infrastructure:

Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level means that SSL decryption and
encryption occur at the load balancer, not the application server. This can be an issue if sensitive data
is transmitted internally (e.g., between the load balancer and application servers)
 without encryption, potentially exposing it to security risks.


Only One MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes:

Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single
point of failure. If the MySQL server fails, write operations won't be
 possible, impacting the website's functionality.


Servers with All the Same Components:
Having all servers with the same components (database, web server, and application server)
 can lead to resource bottlenecks and lack of specialization. It might be more efficient to
 separate specialized servers for different roles to optimize performance and resource utilization.


To address the issues:
1. Use SSL passthrough or end-to-end encryption to ensure SSL is terminated at the application server,
 providing encryption throughout the internal network.
2. Implement database replication and clustering to ensure data redundancy and high availability.
3. Consider using specialized server configurations, such as separate database servers,
 to optimize resource usage and improve performance.
